TeachTeam is a full-stack web-based tutor recruitment system built using Next.js with TypeScript for the frontend and Express.js with TypeORM and MySQL for the backend. It enables tutors to apply for courses and allows lecturers to review, select, and rank candidates through a dynamic dashboard. All user data and actions are now stored in a Cloud MySQL database rather than in browser localStorage, ensuring persistence and reliability across sessions.
